## What is this package
This package is obviously still working on it's name.

I intend to a couple of things here:
- Pull some data from the NOAA grib filter (maybe expand to NODD but we'll see)
and make some graphics of some of the more underused data sets produced by NOAA.
-  Those would be:
    - 80 wind speed
    - Solar irradiance
    - Some diagnostics to help debug those fields
    - That may expand in the future
